# Zoom-Overhaul

At the arise of the Pandemic in mid 2020, many schools were pushed into remote education via Zoom.
As such, the platform worked well for most scenarios, but had some shortcomings that many teachers,
students, administration, and parents faced. With a small team, I decided to provide a bit of a
solution to addressing some of these issues and creating a new template design within Zoom to
better encompass an interactive, learning environment.
